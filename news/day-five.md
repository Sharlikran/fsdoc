In order to properly preserve Historical Data (again Youtube videos) on all the adventures our Dwellers embark upon, a second vault had to be discovered. Once properly recorded the Historical Data can be sorted and added to the Vault library. Hopefully we will have our very own Overseers Office soon." %}
