It is a bustling barrack filled with cheerful Dwellers ready to lend a hand. They were interested in contributing to our Vault Library however, they have noticed that the underground cable system is damaged beyond repair. Only still images can be shared across a makeshift transmission system. Vault 001 and 111 will be the main source of the contributions to the Library. We wished them a fond farewell and they asked us to visit when we can." %}
