If your Diner or Water Treatment Plant shut down because of lack of power then you will not have food for the dwellers." %}

If you can maintain a double wide room that requires 4 people, with 2 or 3 because of their High Special keep it that way." %}

You need the correct people in the correct room so you can under staff rooms enough that you do not run out of resources until the children mature. That may mean having only one couple at a time in the living quarters but that's fine. Slow and steady means you don't run out of resources." %}
