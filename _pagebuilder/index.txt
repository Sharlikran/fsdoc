## Starting again on PC

{{image:beginingagain.jpg | beginingagain}}

I last played in maybe 2015 because that seems to be the last time I updated this wiki. They didn't even have pets when I played. I got one from a free lunch box so we will see how it goes.

For this second time around I'm already struggling with only two weapons and I'm low on population so I can't really make more rooms or make things more efficient yet.

## After Some Work

After some work I'm on my way to building a fantastic vault 111.

## Day Two

Day two has me at 27 dwellers, at least one person per room with a weapon. I have a few people in the Strenght training room for better power management. I'm just waiting on the children to mature.
