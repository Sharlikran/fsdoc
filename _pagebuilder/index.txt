== Starting again on PC

{{image:beginingagain.jpg | beginingagain}}

I last played in maybe 2015 because that seems to be the last time I updated this wiki. They didn't even have pets when I played. I got one from a free lunch box so we will see how it goes.

For this second time around I'm already struggling with only two weapons and I'm low on population so I can't really make more rooms or make things more efficient yet.

== After Some Work

After some work I'm on my way to building a fantastic vault 111.

== Day Two

Day two has me at 27 dwellers, at least one person per room with a weapon. I have a few people in the Strength training room for better power management. I'm just waiting on the children to mature.

== Day Three

Day three and 29 dwellers, and about an hour to go until the Radio Station attracts another Dweller. I have some dwellers with at least 3 or 4 Strength for the Power Plant and I'm maxing our training for a few dwellers for the Diner. Once I get my 30 Dwellers I can get a classroom and finally start training some other dwellers for the Medbay and Science Lab. 

The main reason for all the training is because if they are not happy and in the correct room then they don't level up. I have a few Dwellers that are around level 4 and one of them is still level 1. So I need to get them with an appropriate Special stat and room to increase their level.
