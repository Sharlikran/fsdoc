## Assign a Pet

{{image:assignpet.jpg | assignpet}}

To assign a pet click the small box with the icon of a dog. That indicates this dweller does not have a pet.

A list of available pets will be presented and you will see the benifit the pet provides to the dweller. Obviously you should assign something that benifits the dweller, but if you don't have anything that does just pick one. They are cute.

I chose the dog for Albert because it reduces Training Time. Which for now I assume means training in a room like the Weight Room.
