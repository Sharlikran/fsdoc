<p>I last played in maybe 2015 because that seems to be the last time I updated this wiki. They didn't even have pets when I played. I got one from a free lunch box so we will see how it goes.</p>

<p>For this second time around I'm already struggling with only two weapons and I'm low on population so I can't really make more rooms or make things more efficient yet.</p>

<p>After some work I'm on my way to building a fantastic vault 111.</p>

<p>Day two has me at 27 dwellers, at least one person per room with a weapon. I have a few people in the Strength training room for better power management. I'm just waiting on the children to mature.</p>

<p>{% include image.html file="daythreeand29dwellers.jpg" alt="daythreeand29dwellers" %}</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day three and 29 dwellers, and about an hour to go until the Radio Station attracts another Dweller. I have some dwellers with at least 3 or 4 Strength for the Power Plant and I'm maxing our training for a few dwellers for the Diner. Once I get my 30 Dwellers I can get a classroom and finally start training some other dwellers for the Medbay and Science Lab.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason for all the training is because if they are not happy and in the correct room then they don't level up. I have a few Dwellers that are around level 4 and one of them is still level 1. So I need to get them with an appropriate Special stat and room to increase their level.</p>
